        <p>During my sophomore year, my friend Lauren Hester and I teamed up to create a secondary logo for the <span>Chronicle</span> that would also serve as the magazine’s colophon. Our editor-in-chief had based his editor’s note for the upcoming issue on Walt Whitman’s poem “Pioneers! O Pioneers!” and we thought a pioneer would serve as a good symbol for the magazine’s visual identity as well. After finding a freely licensed photograph of a nineteenth century gold panner online, Lauren painted a six-color depiction of the image, which I then turned into a six-color logo in Adobe Illustrator. We would change the colors of the logo to fit the current issue’s theme in the semesters following.</p>

        <p>As a way to promote the new issue of the <span>Chronicle</span> each semester, the magazine staff would host a release party featuring student readings and showcases and performances by two local bands. We wanted to encourage the Art and English department faculty members to attend just as much as the students, so I would create invitations for the release party, which the staff would distribute to both departments’ faculty members a few weeks before the event.</p>

        <p>In addition to the release party invitations that we sent to faculty members, we would also create flyers for the release party, which our staff would hand out to students in front of the library and other busy locations on campus. I designed this flyer with the help of Chris Phillips, our photographer for the Spring 2014 issue, and Brooke Sidener, our layout editor, who arranged Chris’ photos into a colorful montage for the issue's cover art.</p>
