          <p class="large-body-text center no-headline">When our instructor at The Iron Yard asked us to design a mobile app for a coffee company of our choosing, my first thought was to create an online ordering application for my friend’s historical tea and coffee business.</p>
          <p class="large-body-text center">Although his company, Oliver Pluff &amp; Co., is literally steeped in history, I thought its branding could use some updating. It was a ton of fun combining the old and the new to make an app fit for the present, but that was reminiscent of an earlier era.</p>

            <h3>Home Screen</h3>
            <p>For the app’s home screen, I wanted to give users the impression that they were about to embark on an overseas adventure. I found a map of the Atlantic Ocean dating back to the eighteenth century and added transparent blue and gradient layers to it to create the screen’s background.</p>
            <p>Since the company’s logo was a simple word mark, I also decided to refashion the historical British East India Company's logo into a secondary one for Oliver Pluff &amp; Co.</p>

            <h3>Voyage Screen</h3>
            <p>As a way to encourage users to keep coming back to the app after making an initial purchase, I thought it would be interesting if their previous purchases could be turned into a game of some sort.</p>
            <p>After the user logs into the site from the home page, I wanted to give them the option to proceed to the app’s “Voyage” page, where they can view a map of the places where their previous purchases originated from and also find a suggested “adventure,” highlighting another Oliver Pluff &amp; Co. product that they haven't already tried.</p>

            <h3>Goods Screen 1</h3>
            <p>Because Oliver Pluff &amp; Co. carries an enormous amount of products with bright colonial prints on their packaging, I decided to arrange the products on the first “Goods" screen into a grid format, drawing on the colors in the products’ packaging for the backgrounds of the grid’s squares.</p>
            <p>Users can filter the screen’s results by clicking on one of the three product categories on the blue bar underneath the screen’s hero image.</p>

            <h3>Goods Screen 2</h3>
            <p>Underneath the flavor notes on each product page of the existing Oliver Pluff &amp; Co. website, there’s a short description about that product’s place in history.</p>
            <p>Because the products’ historical significance is obviously an integral part of the company’s brand, I decided to make these descriptions a prominent feature on the product screens of the mobile app as well.</p>

            <h3>Haul Screen 1</h3>

            <p>I also wanted to include a row of three suggested products at the bottom of the screen in case the user was interested in adding any more items to their order.</p>

            <p>I thought it would be fun to use historical microcopy with an antiquated serif typeface to complete the users’ experience.</p>
