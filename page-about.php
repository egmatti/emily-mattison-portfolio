          <p class="no-headline large-body-text">My name is Emily Mattison and I’m a graphic designer and web developer from Spartanburg, SC. I’ve always enjoyed making original things and this early creative spark inspired me to major in English in college so that I could study creative writing. While at school, I got involved with several on-campus organizations that had lots of gifted writers, but not many people who could quickly and easily layout magazines and brochures in a visually appealing way. With a little bit of knowledge of Adobe InDesign, I found myself stepping in to fill those gaps.</p>
          <p class="large-body-text">In the time since then, I’ve taken a variety of graphic communications, art, and user interface design classes, which have allowed me to expand on those initial design skills with a number of cool results. While taking a graphic design internship in Charleston, SC in the fall after I graduated, I became interested in one day using my abilities to provide marketing and creative direction among emerging musical artists.</p>
          <p class="large-body-text">Nowadays, I spend my free time looking for opportunities to make album artwork or websites for musicians and going to concerts or conferences to learn more about web development and the music industry. I also try to volunteer with the Sierra Club and often take my dog on long walks around our neighborhood.</p>
